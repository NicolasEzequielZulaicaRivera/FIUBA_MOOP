### Intro

Combinatorial Problems

- Set Coverage
- Knapsack Problem
- Task Scheduling

### Set Coverage ( CObertura de conjuntos )

#### Example

For the following numbers: 1,2,3,4,5 (N)

We have the following subsets (Si) :

1. 1,2
2. 1,3,5
3. 3
4. 1
5. 4,5

We'll have a bivalent var for each subset Yi that indicates if it selected

##### Must Cover Problem

We want to cover all numbers with with the least cost

Restrictions:

for each N : sum( Yi if N in Si ) >= 1

Z = min sum Yi

##### With No repetitions ( Problemas de grupos que se particionan )

The intersection of selected subsets must be null, there can be no overlap

Restrictions:

for each N : sum( Yi if N in Si ) = 1

Z = min sum Yi

##### Packing Problem

no repetitions & it's imposible to cover all all elements,
so we try to cover the maximum amount of elements possible

for each N : sum( Yi if N in Si ) = bool XN

Z = max sum XN

### Knapsack Problem

i elements, each w/ a value and a weight

Yi = 1{ element i is taken }

sum( Yi \* weight_i ) <= max_weight

MAX Z = sum( Yi \* value_i )

> This blows up for a large number of elements

#### Alter: Multiple Knapsack Problems

Yij = 1{ element i is in bag j }

for each j: sum_i ( weight_i Yij ) <= max_weight_j

for each i: Yi = sum_j ( Yij )

MAX Z = sum_i ( value_i Yij )

#### Alter: Elements may be repeated

Xi = integer : how many times element of type i is in the bag

sum( Xi \* weight_i ) <= max_weight

Xi <= available_i

MAX Z = sum( Xi \* value_i )

### Scheduling - Task Scheduling (CalendarizaciÃ³n)

Lets say we have 2 machines and multiple tasks.

A task first goes through the first machine, then the second.

We want to minimize the total time it takes to complete all tasks.

- tasks will not be interrupted

#### Example

| Task | Time M1 | Time M2 |
| :--: | :-----: | :-----: |
|  A   |    1    |    2    |
|  B   |    6    |    8    |
|  C   |    5    |    6    |
|  D   |    7    |    4    |

we'll want to know the start time of each task in each machine

Iij # time task i starts in machine j
Fij = Iij + Tij # time task i starts in machine j

Ii2 >= Fi1 # it cant start on the next machine until the previous one is done

for each i : FinalTime >= Fi2

```
Supose 2 tasks

M Y_A1B1 + I_A1 >= F_B1
M Y_B1A1 + I_B1 >= F_A1

Y_A1B1 + Y_B1A1 = 1

we need to do this for each pair of tasks

```
