## Introduction

<input type="date" value="2022-03-23" />

- First exam, up to whatever wee see in practice ( 1st 3 practices ) , sat 24
- Final exam, may bring notes
- Keep up to date
- Participation mark in practice classes ( sats )

### Analytics

- **Objective**: analyse systems , working w/ lineal mathematical models.
- Branch(?) of **Operative science** ( appliance of modern science to complex problems )
- **Decision Problem**
  - may arise when there are multiple ( valid ) alternatives with different results / efficiencies
  - there are doubts about alternative courses
  - there may be to many alternatives to analyse
- Need to know
  - Person ( or entity ) **responsible** of taking the decision
  - ^ their context
  - ^ their goal/s ( might be subjective )
- A model has
  - To be able to compare two alternatives and decide which is better
  - Controllable variables ( we might treat something variable as fixed )

#### Models

##### Classification

- Iconic
  - Represent reality closely
  - eg. blueprint , CV
  - Gives an overview . Helps for _small_ decisions or filtering ( rejecting alternatives )
- Analogic
  - Represents something that would otherwise be complex to represent
  - eg. map w/ altitude would be the analogic alternative to a 3d mock-up
- Symbolic
  - Greatly abstracted, reality is not visibly represented
  - Types
    - Schematic
    - Mathematic - Descriptive or Optimizing - Stochastic or Deterministic - Static or dynamic (?) - Historic or Planing
      > We'll work w/ mathematic optimizing & deterministic models
      > This methods have a need for continuous variables

##### Why we use models

- Simpler to use
- May use techniques designed for the models
- When correctly applied, the model will behave like the real phenomena

##### Hypothesis & Assumptions

- We may delimit/simplify the subject of study
  - To simplify the problem
  - By discarding/fixing variables
  - in such a manner, a physical system becomes a symbolic model
- Hypothesis must be proven scientifically

##### Objective

- Measures the performance of a model
- Arises from 3 questions
  - What ? -> fundamental/controllable variables
  - When ? -> restrictions
  - Why ? ( optimizing models : minimize / maximize ) -> objective

##### Activities

- Has to be measured as a variable
  - || Consume resources
  - || Generates a result
  - || Indicates a state

##### Restrictions

- Restrictions to the variables or results ( >= , <= , = )
- Slack restrictions: do not affect the solution

> Ran out of money

##### Solution

###### Limit options

- If
  - Z is a lineal function
  - lineal restrictions
  - continuos variables
- Then
  - the min/max will be in at least 1 vertex

###### Functional

- use the functional ( lines where Z has the same value )
  - graph them until the min/max meets the restrictions

### Excercise

- Objective
  - what ? -> determine how much [amaranto in x] & [boxes in y] should be bought
  - why ? -> minimize the cost of the purchase
  - when ? -> The next weekend
- Restrictions
  - end up with at least 100kg of each product
- Assumptions
  - We don't care having more than 100kg
  - Time fits
  - No other costs, any resource not mentioned is not limiting
- Initial state
  - amaranto 20kg
  - quinoa 50kg
- Variables / Options
  - VH . [amaranto in x] : 1kg for $100 , up to 40kg
  - SV . [boxes in y] : boxes of 1kg amaranto & 5kg quinoa for $600 , up to 30 boxes

#### Equations

- Products
  - amaranto: 20 kg + 2kg · SV + 1kg · VH >= 100kg
  - quinoa: 50 kg + 5kg · VH >= 100kg
- CNN : condicion de no negatividad(??)
  - VH <= 40
  - SV <= 30
- Objective
  - Z(min) = VH · 100 \$ + SV · 600 \$
